## BST Functions 40 Marks

*Complete the implementation of a binary search tree in the Program.cs file provided by filling in the code requested. The methods/functions to implement are:*

- [X] staticbool IsEqual(Node item1, Node item2)
- [X] staticvoid InsertTree(Tree tree, Node item)
- [X] staticbool SearchTree(Node tree, DataEntry value)
- [X] staticbool SearchTreeItem(Node tree, Node item)
- [X] staticvoid DeleteItem(Tree tree, Node item)
- [X] staticint Size(Tree tree)
- [X] staticint Depth(Node tree)
- [ ] static Node Parent(Tree tree, Node node)
- [ ] static Node FindMax(Node tree)
- [ ] staticvoid DeleteMin(Tree tree)

## Set Data Type Functions 12 Marks

*Implement the following functions for a Binary Search Tree (BST) in the Program.cs file. The methods/functions to implement are:*

- [ ] static Tree Union(Tree tree1, Tree tree2)
- [ ] static Tree Intersection(Tree tree1, Tree tree2)
- [ ] static Tree Difference(Tree tree1, Node tree2)
- [ ] static Tree SymmetricDifference(Node tree1, Tree tree2)

*This subtask interprets Trees as representing mathematical Sets and asks to implement the basic Set operations. Short descriptions of each function, its arguments and return values are in the file Program.cs. Do not change these method prototypes. Each method is worth a maximum of 3 marks individually.*
